### Purpose 
During Block 6, we will be conducting a small survey and asses if a particular personality trait can influence an individual's choice and we will analyze this by implementing some statistical tools.

Limitations are: We are surveying under 100 individuals that are not neccessarily independently distributed.

### Research Question: 
*Does self-perceived competitiveness of an individual influence where they prefer to sit in class?*
