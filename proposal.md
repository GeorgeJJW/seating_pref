# Milestone 1: Proposal

### Question of interest

Seating location in the classroom is commonly linked to grade performance, student engagement, and learning experience. Nevertheless, the question remains whether certain personality dispositions systematically influence where students prefer to sit in a classroom.

To address this gap in the literature, this study aims to explore the relationship between students' self-reported competitiveness and their seating preference. Specifically, this study will survey 69 Master of Data Science students at the University of British Columbia. The main objective of this survey is to explore the question: **Does self-reported competitiveness influence where an individual prefer to sit in class?**

The survey will collect _seating preference_ with the following question:

Where do you prefer to sit in a classroom?

- [ ] Front of the class
- [ ] Middle of the class
- [ ] Back of the class
- [ ] Prefer not to respond

The survey will measure _self-reported competitiveness_ with the following three questions:

Do you enjoy competing against others?
Do you like situations in which you compete with others?
Do you prefer competing with others when pursuing a goal over pursuing the goal alone?

Participants will answer these questions Using a 5-point Likert scale, with 1 being "very much not so", and 5 being "very much so".

### Potential confounds



What gender do you identify with?

- [ ] Male
- [ ] Female
- [ ] Other
- [ ] Prefer not to respond

### Plan of analysis

**Null Hypothesis**: Self-perceived competitiveness has no influence on students' preference on where they usually sit.

**Alternative Hypothesis**: The competitiveness of a student has affects on their preference on where they usually sit.

We plan to analyze our survey results in the following steps:

**Step 1**:  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Briefly summarize the main characteristics of variables. 
- Adjust assumption or method if needed.
	
**Step 2**:  Develop Regression Test in R statistical software

- Use a two-tail hypothesis test on our response variable.
- Perform Linear Regression test based on the survey results. 
- Decide whether to keep interaction terms by conducting Likelihood Ratio Test on different models. 
- Interpret the effects of the significant predictor variables.

### Ethics and other considerations

All online survey data will be stored and accessed in Canada only and will be destroyed upon completition of this project. 
No private information (such as names, IP address, or any information that can identify someone) will be collected in the survey. 
A consent form/cover letter will be issued.
