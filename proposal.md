# Milestone 1: Proposal

### Question of interest



This study aims to explore the relationship between students' self-perceived competitiveness and their seating preference. Specifically, this study plans to address the question: **Does self-perceived competitiveness influence where an individual prefer to sit in class?**



Where do you prefer to sit in a classroom?

- [ ] Front of the class
- [ ] Middle of the class
- [ ] Back of the class
- [ ] Prefer not to respond

### Potential confounds



What gender do you identify with?

- [ ] Male
- [ ] Female
- [ ] Other
- [ ] Prefer to not respond

### Plan of analysis

**Null Hypothesis**: Self-perceived competitiveness has no influence on students' preference on where they usually sit.

**Alternative Hypothesis**: The competitiveness of a student has affects on their preference on where they usually sit.

We plan to analyze our survey results in the following steps:

**Step 1**:  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Briefly summarize the main characteristics of variables. 
- Adjust assumption or method if needed.
	
**Step 2**:  Develop Regression Test in R statistical software

- Use a two-tail hypothesis test on our response variable.
- Perform Linear Regression test based on the survey results. 
- Decide whether to keep interaction terms by conducting Likelihood Ratio Test on different models. 
- Interpret the effects of the significant predictor variables.

### Ethics and other considerations

No private information (such as names, IP address, or any information that can identify someone) will be collected in the survey.
