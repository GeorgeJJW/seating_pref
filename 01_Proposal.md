### Statistics Analysis

**Null Hypothesis**: The competitiveness of a student has no affect on their preference on where they usually sit.
**Alternative Hypothesis**: The competitiveness of a student has affects on their preference on where they usually sit.

We plan to analyze our survey results in the following steps:

**Step 1**:  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Briefly summarize the main characteristics of variables. 
- Adjust assumption or method if needed.
	
**Step 2**:  Develop Regression Test in R statistical software
- Use a two-tail hypothesis test on our response variable.
- Perform Linear Regression test based on the survey results. 
- Decide whether to keep interaction terms by conducting Likelihood Ratio Test on different models. 
- Interpret the effects of the significant predictor variables.
